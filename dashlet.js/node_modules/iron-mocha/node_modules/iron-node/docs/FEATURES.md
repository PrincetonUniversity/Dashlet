# ironNode Features
Some people asked for a feature comparison table or want me to tell them why ironNode is better than other Node.js deb√∫gging tools. Well this is not trivial because ironNode is a little bit different in the way it works and in the usage workflow. Anyway I want to try out to describe the fetaures.

First of all ironNode is a debugger no more and no less. So it does what you expect and it claims to do this with better performance than other debug tools in workflow and usage.  
ironNode have the powerful DevTools JavaScript debugger interface under the hood. It supports almost all of the debugging features of DevTools including...

## Execution controls
Continue, Step over, Step into, Step out, Toggle [conditional] breakpoints, Call Stack panel, Blackbox JavaScript files, Pause on Exceptions, Pause on Uncaught Exceptions.

## Interaction with paused breakpoints
Inspect and edit scopes, variables and object properties, Live Editing, Exception tracking, Viewing exception stack trace and Console output inspection.

#### More... and more. Get a very detailed description at [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging).


## :yellow_heart: +Features
ironNode have io.js under the hood. As a result of this it supports EcmaScript 6 (ES6 Harmony) out of the box without any precompilers. [Screenshot](http://s-a.github.io/iron-node/iron-node__es6__lg.jpg).  
Restart your project with ```ctrl+r``` shortcut.


## :sunglasses: Cool stuff
ironNode does support themes.  
ironNode does not use WebSockets or something like this. (No connection lost messages or something like that).  
ironNode works independent of local node installation because it has its own.  
No too fast scripts to attach the debugger problems.  
No ```--debug-brk``` or other preperation necessary to start a debug session.  
No UI in a weird states.  
NO UI doesn't load or doesn't work and refresh didn't help  
No Node Inspector takes a long time to start up.

### :no_entry: Limitations
Native modules need a recompilation against the current electron version. Please read ["How to use native modules?"](/docs/NATIVE-MODULES.md).  
As part of design ironNode does not support remote debugging, debugging of multiple processes (e.g. cluster).
